# Studio Ghibli Recommendation Project
## **Unit 2 Project**

#### API project that will show a random Ghibli film with a brief summary of what it is about when the Ghibli Movie button is clicked. A user can also marked a recommendation as a favorite by clicking the "This is My Favorite" button on the page (v1 of this project only shows the text on the page. Maybe future updates to create a Favorites list). There is a link on the page that will link to my personal recommendations with some of my thoughts about the movies I've picked.

#### The API used for this project is located [here](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/). 

#### The specific information pulled from the API is the Title, Image and Description of the movie all presented on the page.
