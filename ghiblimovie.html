        <h1>Onyee's Recommendations</h1>
        <p>My favorite Ghibli movie out of all of the movies that Miyazaki has created is Princess Monoke. It's a movie that speaks on the relationship that we as humans have with the enviroment.</p>
        <img class="movie_poster" src="https://www.pride.com/sites/default/files/princess-mononoke-ghibli-fest-2019-review-still-relevant-22-year-anniversary.jpg" alt="PMimage">
        <p>With any of the Ghibli movies I definitely recommend watching them subbed as opposed to dubbed. Some of the translations and acting in the dubbed version isn't bad but I always watched these movies subbed so it holds a sentimental meaning watching it in it's original form.</p>
        <p>The one Ghibli movie I would give caution before watching is Grave of the FireFlies. While the movie is good (it feels weird to say that considering it's subject matter) it is a tough watch as it goes through the story of 2 children in war torn Japan and their struggle to survive on their own.
            While the movie is hard to get through, I do think there is something about covering deeper topics of life like this in an animated film...but watch at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>For an easy watch with good animation I'd go with Kiki's Delivery Service.</p>
